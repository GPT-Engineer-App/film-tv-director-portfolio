# film-tv-director-portfolio

A business website for a film & TV director. The website should showcase the director's portfolio, including past projects in both film and television. It should have a sleek, professional design with a focus on visual elements to highlight the director's work. Include sections for an about page, portfolio, contact form, and a blog for updates. The visual style should be cinematic, with a black, white, and gray color scheme to keep the focus on the director's work.
